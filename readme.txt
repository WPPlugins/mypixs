== Description ==

MyPixs is a simple, yet powerful JavaScript and PHP application that gives you the possibility
to display a lot of photos on your blog, without them taking up a lot of space.

Your visitors will get to see a small thumbnail (90x90) of the first photo in your set, and can open it by clicking on it.
Then, they can pick a photo they want to see, and it will open in the same window as your blog. (Kinda like Lightbox)

== Installation ==

1. UnZip the downloaded folder, and upload it to your plugins directory. (your_wordpress_folder/wp-content/plugins/)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in wordpress
